Files:
  OFPF_Single_Item.py: Run simulation for single item
  OFPF_Multiple_Item_noRepeat.py: Run simulation for multi item
  data_generator.py: Generates sample p, s and c values to be used in single and multi item simulations
  merchant*/pick_hist: Pick rates by location, for the respective merchant.
  merchant*/store_vol_hist: Store volume histogram - Number of orders by store, for the respective merchant
  merchant*/ld.zip: Unzip this file and move the ld.tsv thus created in a subdir merchant* to the parent dir. Used to sample orders to get features for sampling p, s and c values.
  store_volume_labor2.csv: File containing labor costs

Steps to run:
  Single item:
    python OFPF_Single_Item.py merchant1 merchant1/ld.tsv merchant1 merchant1/store_vol_hist merchant1/pick_hist

    Sample data used in simulation is also saved at Data_SI/merchant*_noTF
    Results will be saved under Results_Single_Item/
  Multi item:
    python OFPF_Multiple_Item_noRepeat.py merchant1 merchant1/ld.tsv merchant1 merchant1/store_vol_hist merchant1/pick_hist    
    
    Sample data used in simulation is also saved at Data_MI/merchant*_noTF
    Results will be saved under Results_MI/Individual_Type
